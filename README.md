# EFEngine

This is an OpenGL game engine library that can be used to make graphical applications and/or games.
It has many included features like a math library, physics libray, shape generator, model importer, image importer, and many other
custom functions that I have coded myself to help create an OpenGL application/game from scratch.

I have included a couple examples that can be run to demonstrate some of these functions.
